The [audio-dataset-converter](https://github.com/waikato-llm/audio-dataset-converter) 
library (and its dependent libraries) can be used for converting **audio datasets** from one format 
into another. It has I/O support for the following domains:

* Audio classification
* Speech

Please refer to the [dataset formats](https://github.com/waikato-llm/audio-dataset-converter?tab=readme-ov-file#dataset-formats)
section for more details on supported formats.

But the library does not just convert datasets, you can also slot in complex filter pipelines to 
process/clean the data.

On this website you can find examples and documentation for:

* [Audio classification](audio_classification.md)
* [Speech](speech.md)
* [Filter usage](filters.md)
* [Placeholders](placeholders.md)
* [Execution control](execution_control.md)
* [External functions](pyfunc.md)
* [Multiple I/O](multi.md)
* [Email](email.md)
* [File handling](file_handling.md)
* [Temporary storage](storage.md)
* [Docker usage](docker.md)

Examples for the additional libraries:

* [Faster whisper](faster_whisper.md)
* [Redis](redis.md)
* [Visualization](visualization.md)
